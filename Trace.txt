Expanding initial state...
1 2 3 
4 0 6 
7 5 8 

The best state to expand with a g(n) = 1 and h(n) = 1 is...
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 0 8 

Goal!!
To solve this problem the search algorithm expanded a total of 2 nodes.
The maximum number of nodes in the queue at any one time was 5.
The depth of the goal node was 2.
